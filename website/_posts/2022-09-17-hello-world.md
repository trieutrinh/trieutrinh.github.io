This is my first ever blog post. To be fair I don't really know what I should write here so I am just going to do a bit of a brain dump. I want to use this initial blog post to just say hi and invite you to walk alongside me on this journey of self-learning, tinkering, and cursing a piece of silicon for not behaving the way we'd expect it to.

## üîÅ Post Frequency

Hopefully, this will be the start of a great journey and not another one of those projects that I start and then get distracted by another shiny thing and completely forget about (damn my goldfish attention span üò¢ ). I *hope* to post somewhat regularly, maybe once or twice a month to begin with, and then adjust and recalibrate as I go.

## üéØ Topics

In this blog, I will write about my projects and the things I am experimenting with. This can range from random automation projects I am working on in my Home Lab, to various hardware projects involving Arduino and Raspberry Pi boards, to studying for certifications, and so on. Consider this the *"Captain's log"* on my journey to slowly but surely lose my mental sanity.

I was also considering the option to talk about books I am currently reading, but I think that may be a bit too off-topic. We'll see how desperate I get trying to come up with content ideas, I guess üòÖ

## ‚ùî Ok, cool... But Why?

Ok, ok... So we established I am probably hopefully going to try and do this. Cool. But why am I doing it? What's in it for me?

### üôè Help out the community that has helped me along the way

To say that random blogs scattered across the interwebs written by some rando have helped and guided me on my journey thus far is a MASSIVE understatement. I stand on the shoulders of these blog posts and I learned more from them than I did from **most** of my university courses...

That being said, I would like to become a "random dude who posted something interesting" for someone else. If I can help out at least another desperate soul that went past the first page of google results looking for a solution to their problem, then I call that a win (a W, as kids these days would say).

### üìù Document my learning and projects

Picture this scenario, and tell me it ain't just me who ran into this. You are working on the next fabulous project that probably nobody else besides you will use or see. You ran into the most obscure issue that you ever saw in your life and wasted hours if not days or even weeks to solve it. Approximately 5 minutes go by while you work on something else, and you already forgot the solution.

Wouldn't it be nice if you had a central knowledge base or something to just dump all these findings? Wouldn't it be even nicer if you spent the extra 5-10 minutes to format it in a way that someone else could bear reading it and maybe help them out as well?

Well, there you got. That's that.

Also, this is a good pretense for me to write documentation for my projects and just talk about the process itself. I used to find DevLogs captivating back in the day and watched quite a bit of them on YouTube.

### üò® Fear of missing out

I watched one too many YouTube videos that make bold claims such as "Any developer that doesn't blog is making a huge mistake".

## Conclusion

Aight, I've already far exceeded the word count I thought I'd be able to regurgitate in a single night. I'll catch y'all later in my next, positively enthralling and unquestionably thought-provoking blog post.
No promises but it'll probably be one of the following:

- My first steps when deploying a new Proxmox Server
- How to pet a cat
- Why do people like lists of 3 so much?
